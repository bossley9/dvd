# dvd

dvd - an ncurses bouncing dvd logo in just 200 lines of C!

I mostly made this because I was bored and wanted to learn the ncurses interface library.
Feel free to fork off my code and modify it however you like.

## Requirements

* ncurses

## Installation

Installation is as simple as running the following commands (where $ denotes elevated privileges):

```
make
$ make install
```

## Running

Once installed, run the following command in a terminal:

```
dvd
```
